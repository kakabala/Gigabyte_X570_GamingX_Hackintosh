# USB Port Map

Here's the USB port map for the Gigabyte Aorus Z390 Master I have discovered using the great [USBMap script](https://github.com/corpnewt/USBMap).

 * **HS01/SS01:** Front USB-C
 * **HS02/SS02:** Unknown
 * **HS03/SS03:** Rear USB 3.1 (red, second from Ethernet)
 * **HS04/SS04:** Rear USB 3.1 (red, next to Ethernet)
 * **HS05/SS05:** Rear USB 3.1 (red, next to USB-C)
 * **HS06/SS06:** Rear USB-C
 * **HS07/SS07:** Rear USB 3.0 (yellow) - next to HDMI
 * **HS08/SS08:** Rear USB 3.0 (yellow)
 * **HS09/SS09:** Front USB 3.0 #1
 * **HS10/SS10:** Front USB 3.0 #2
 * **HS11:** Rear USB 2 (all ports)
 * **HS12:** Internal USB2
 * **HS13:** Internal USB2
 * **HS14:** Bluetooth/Wifi

## Ports I kept enabled:
 * HS03/SS03
 * HS04/SS04
 * HS05/SS05
 * HS06/SS06
 * HS09/SS09
 * HS10/SS10
 * HS11
 * HS12
 * HS13

**Total:** 15 ports

Or in other words, I disabled:
 * both yellow USB3 ports next to the HDMI port
 * the Front USB-C header
 * HS2 (unknown)
 * Bluetooth/Wifi

## USB.plist

I have included the [`USB.plist`](assets/USB.plist) file I generated with USBMap. This is specific to the Gigabyte Aorus z390 Master board and will NOT work with similar boards (such as the Elite or Pro). Each port is named to make things a bit easier.

In order to use my USB map, just copy the included `USB.plist` to `USBMap/Scripts`. By using my USB map, you will not spend time discovering your ports.
